I've been playing around with a cheap capacitive soil moisture sensor and an Arduino Uno-like Chinese board. <br />
This is the code I've used for the sensor with comments explaining it. <br />
There's various tutorials for these sensors online but the one I watched was [this one by DIY Engineers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrchcjYsV1I). I'm also using the exact same sensor as in the video. <br />

As mentioned in the video, connecting the sensor's VCC pin to a board's digital pin allows us to power it on only when we need to.
